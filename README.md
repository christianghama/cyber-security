# Excel Hash
This repository contains an exercise I have created to study the concept of [Hashing Algorithms](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/hashing-algorithm#:~:text=Cryptographic%20hashing%20algorithms%2C%20also%20known,product%2C%20called%20the%20hash%20value.) in cyber security. 

The exercise consists of processing a given hypotetical Excel table which contains information that the author doesn't want anyone else to modify, but view without having to use the traditional solution of locking the spreadsheet from editing by using a password (https://bit.ly/3Wi3Wyd), in this exercise the author you will be able to share the spreadsheet with the reviewers and check later whether it was modified by using macro VBScripts programmed with a simple hash algorithm.

## The source table

The source Excel table is available in the spreadsheet
