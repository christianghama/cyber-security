# Excel Hash
This repository contains an exercise I have created to study the concept of hashing in cybsersecurity. 

The exercise consists in processing a given hypotetical Excel table which contains information that the author doesn't want anyone else can modify, although it can be viewed by anybody who has access to it (i.e., received it by email or shared in the cloud or network). Instead of the traditional solution of locking the spreadsheet from editing by using a password (https://bit.ly/3Wi3Wyd), in this exercise the author you will be able to share the spreadsheet with the reviewers and check later wether it was modified by using macro VBScripts programmed with a simple hash algorithm.
